# Memory Cards / Flash Cards
Simple app built following along a project based class that includes 20 vanilla JavaScript classes taught by Brad Traversy on Udemy.
I realized I was not leaving a link to Brad's actual class from Udemy in my past 2 projects, so you can find that here.

## 3rd Installment of my 50 project marathon.
I thought this would be a good one to build as I am currently using flash cards to help me teach my 7 year old how to read. Like Brad say's in his class often, I plan to take this app a little further later on. I might style it using a styling framework, as well as build a backend to connect with MongoDB. Brad actually teaches another class on Udemy with a much larger project featuring the ability to register users. I plan to combine that with this to make this a full fledged app that way different users can store their own sets of flash cards. I know for me I use flash cards all the time, and I am always in favor of getting away from using paper as much as I can. Plus, of course, my son loves any excuse he has to get on the "computer". (:

## Day 3 of #100DaysOfCode and #100DaysOfTrailhead
I'll be honest I missed Trailhead yesterday, I need to have a bit more discipline about getting EVERYTHING in everyday.. The small coding project take me about an hour to two hours each day so I have definitely been getting that in. I will be sure to start getting Trailhead in everyday first thing in the morning as well. But, 3 days in 3 projects built! I discovered yet another online coding academy yesterday that looks pretty promising and I was granted early access to it. Completely project based so perfect to supplement my 100 day challenge. Again more on that later!
